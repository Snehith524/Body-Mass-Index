# Body-Mass-Index

The BMI Calculator is a straightforward application designed to help users determine their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. This calculator provides an easy-to-use console interface, allowing users to input their weight in kilograms and height in meters. Once the inputs are received, the application computes the BMI using the formula:

BMI
=
weight (kg)
height (m)
2
BMI= 
height (m) 
2
 
weight (kg)
​
 

The program then classifies the result into different weight categories: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obesity. This application serves as a quick tool for individuals to assess their weight status and can be useful for health tracking and awareness.
